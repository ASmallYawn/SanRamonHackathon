      <p>Being safe from Covid is a huge concern for many people planning to go on vacation during this pandemic. That's why we created this app to help people know which places have a higher risk of contracting the virus from. Simply search for the place that you want to go to, and the app will provide you with a risk score that is calculated using data from multiple sources, such as <a href="https://apidocs.covidactnow.org/">covidactnow.org</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">CDC</a>.</p>
